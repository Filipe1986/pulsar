Code Samples for StreamNative Academy's Getting Started with Pulsar on StreamNative
courses.streamnative.io

SUBSCRIPTION TYPES
Show where to get SNProducer and SNConsumer from UI.
Make small changes to SNProducer and SNConsumer to demonstrate Exclusive, Failover, and Shared Subscriptions Types.
Exclusive: run multiple consumers, see error when second consumer tries to connect
Failover: run multiple consumers, see both are able to connect, only one is active, turn off first and second becomes active
Shared: use Sleep to demonstrate a slow consumer and limit the size of the consumer queue to just 1 message (1000 is default)
Key_Shared: will introduce later with partitioned topics and keys

SCHEMA
Producer/Consumer examples with String schema, JSON and AVRO schema
Introduce Pulsar Datagen Connector as data source with JSON schema, consume with SNConsumerDatagen

MULTI-TENANCY
Create non super-admin service account, mytenant and mynamespace, apply tenant admin privileges
Alternately can add produce and consumer permissions on the tenant/namespace
Convert SNProducer and SNConsumer to use mytenant/mynamespace

TOPIC PARTITIONING, KEYS, and SUBSCRIPTIONS REVISITED
Increase number of partitions from 1 to 3
Introduce key to byte example using case statement
Exclusive: (in order on a per partition basis)
Failover: (up to 3 can be active when have 3 partitions, work divided by partition)
Shared: process as fast as possible, mostly random
Key-Shared: distributed in order by key, can have more than number of partitions
